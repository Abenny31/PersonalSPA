      "I’m a software engineer with a solid background in .NET and SQL Server, plus hands-on experience with React and TypeScript. I'm learning Azure administration and have practical know-how deploying apps to IIS and similar environments. I’m currently focused on complex desktop applications and REST/SOAP API systems—maintaining, modernizing, and integrating services that keep critical workflows running.",
      "Previously, I led teams responsible for people coordination, planning, and end-to-end project execution—experience that sharpened my communication and delivery. I bring that structure into software: connecting stakeholders, translating requirements into clear solutions, and shipping maintainable features. Curious by nature, I enjoy mentoring and continuously investing in learning across the Microsoft ecosystem."
